					<p>I just realize I must improve my capbility of english writing. So I decide to wirite my darily life by english since the day. Of course, grammar and vocabulary correct work should depends on google Translation.</p>
<p>Now, it is 4:51 a.m. I am writing my first english daniary, since I have a dramly sleep problem .</p>
<p>There is a group party in Jan.16th which I realy look forward to. However, I should go shopping with my Prof. and senior group sister in Jan.15th. To be honest, I am a little bit fear of it —— I am a social fear people.</p>
<p>I read too much romantic stories these days, I almost forget I am in school term. It just like still in vacation —— do whatever I want to do, sleep at morning and get up at evenning. My Prof. is very kind and never push —— I really don't deserve him.</p>
<p>Come on, I don't want to be a loster. I dreams that get PHD. aboard and learn more about the wanderful world. I really should chrish my time and spend it in meanningful stuff. I need to make up for my bad math and english fundamators. Please dno't spoil yourself. In the idea situation, I should get up at 7:00 am every morning and go to bed 11 pm every evening. I should never waist my time in useless romatic stories. Please, be a better guy.</p>
